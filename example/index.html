Try the following:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/employees?first-name=Abdul">/employees?first-name=Abdul</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/employees">/employees</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/people?is-adult=true">/people?is-adult=true</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/people">/people</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/groups">/groups</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/people/5">/people/5</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/groups/1001">/groups/1001</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <pre>
curl -i -k -XPUT https://localhost:3000/people/5 \
 -d '{"id":5,"firstName":"Samuel","nickname":"Sammy the Sam-man","lastName":"Otto","dob":1488472400000,"groupId":1001}' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
        </pre>
        Notice that this changes person 5's nickname, and date of birth.  The date of birth change causes
        the "isAdult" field to become false, since it is a computed property.  Those changes are also reflected in the
        "/groups" endpoint, even though the PUT was only to the "/people" endpoint.  This works since
        computed properties are re-computed on each fetch, and the computed property
        for groups looks up the members from the people resource.  These changes are not persisted to the json files;
        a copy of those files is kept in memory and mutated as PUTs, POSTs, etc, are done.
